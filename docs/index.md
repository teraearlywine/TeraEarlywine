> "Data is like garbage. You'd better know what you are going to do with it before you collect it." - Mark Twain

Welcome to my website and mkdocs repository. If you're here, that means either you just stumbled on my page (nice) or are a co-worker of past, present, or future (hey friend!). As I'm sure you're aware, GitHub is a *powerful* tool for project management, engineering, and development, and is genuinely the most satisfying archival tool I've ever worked with. (And I've worked with a lot...)

Now, as I enter the fifth year of my career, venturing into different echelons of engineering, I think it's important to maintain a continuous practice of things that matter. So, as of 2024, I have curated these guiding professional principles that I intend to practice and uphold as a reminder. These principles are also a notice to you, dear visitor, of the standards to which I hold myself accountable.


## 8 Guiding Professional Principles

1. Always be 2 minutes *early* to meetings
2. For any idea you believe in, always create a proposal
3. Any writing shall be reviewed & edited before sending to others
4. Feedback is a gift, however, delivery of feedback is just as important as receiving
5. Data Engineering related work:
    1. Automate, automate, automate!
    2. Always bake in unit tests & assertions
    3. Always add doc-strings/code comments
    4. Always have a quality assurance analysis prepared as a deliverable
    5. When building dashboards, use rule of 3rds
    6. Check with backend for modeling logic, check with stakeholders to confirm business understanding.
6. Always push yourself to learn more and to have a sense of humor when things go awry.
7. Data is a gift, you are but a conduit, so honor the information given to you.
8. Prefer to _have_ data as opposed to _no_ data.
