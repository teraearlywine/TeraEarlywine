## Welcome


Hello there stranger, friend or stranger friend! Welcome to my personal GitHub repository! I am happy you're here. 

This repo currently points (and publishes to) www.teraearlywine.com, which consists of a more readable website made using mkdocs. The repositories below are merely tasters of python & SQL samples. They have no general use other than highlighting that yes, I can in fact code. If you want to see more of my personal skill set and passions come to light, check out [TeraTheDataConsultant](https://github.com/TeraTheDataConsultant)


Thanks for stopping by! 

Best, 
Tera
