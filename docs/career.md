# Career

## **Welcome**


**Hello! Welcome to my Career Page!** <br><br>
Full stack data professional with +6 years of industry experience. Specializes in economic and marketplace analysis, data modeling, API automation and data visualization. Basically, I'm like a superhero, but instead of a cape, I wear blue light glasses and instead of fighting crime, I fight against inefficiency. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying to make sense of my own personal data, like how many cups of coffee it takes me to become a functional human being. Lets connect.

And no, I'm not kidding with the coffee thing.



## **Experience**

Welcome to an overview of my professional journey over the past six years. This period has been rich with learning experiences, mentorship opportunities, growth, and numerous achievements. My career path, driven largely by a deep-seated curiosity, began in the realm of data. However, as time progressed, my interests increasingly veered towards engineering and technology.


In the sections below, you'll find detailed tabs for each position I've held in the last five years. These provide an extensive overview – a comprehensive catalogue created for both personal reflection and storytelling. I take great pleasure in organizing and presenting information, sometimes delving deeply into context to provide a full picture.


??? note
    What you'll see here is much more detailed than my job-application resume, which is a more concise representation of these experiences. This detailed version is a testament to my love for storytelling and meticulous classification of information.

    **Summary**


   I transitioned into a new role approximately around the middle of 2023, to a team that is focusing on third-party vendor integrations. My current focus has been maintaining and optimizing ad vendor APIs. My daily tasks involve Python modeling within Google Cloud Platform's Composer environments where I am responsible for maintaining and refactoring our codebase. Since then, I have revamped our onboarding process in GCP. This revamp included utilizing Terraform for the efficient deployment of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) resources.

   In addition to API integration, I also work actively on SQL development, building production-grade analytics pipelines for the executive team and beyond. Mercaris shipping and logistics data is very fascinating. The Mercari micro-economies are constantly evolving.


    ??? success "Lessons from 2023"

        Being successful to start meant just learning, that stayed true as time went on. Later, success also started to mean ensuring the code I inhereted was clean and well documented. The pipelines I've worked on were set up by other people, many hands in the pie. I spent time adding documentation and building out a testing suite. This is where I really learned the importance of readability, documentation and simplification.

        Duration: 2021 - 2022

        This was arguably one of the most challenging data analytics engineering experiences I've had - just purely because the business model is so complex. Alice's aim was to create a pre-tax benefit service for hourly employees, which required I study up on health and tax laws.
