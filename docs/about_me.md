# About Me

Hi! My name is Tera. I grew up on the peninsula (bay area) and am currently bopping around Northern California. I do data engineering things, but not entirely by design. I’ve always been curious about the flow of information, when I was a kid I loved to make lists of things (random - but yes) so it always seemed that my career, naturally, started in Business Intelligence. With each year that passes, this same curiosity has driven me deeper into the ‘why’ of data. Ergo data engineering. Otherwise, I enjoy painting, cooking and various creative endeavors. Exploring the different ‘whys’ of things makes life beautiful to me.

I felt like it was time to start sharing some of the professional philosophies about data I’ve developed as my experience has grown. I hope you find some of these series, philosophies and lessons compelling. Thank you for stopping by!
