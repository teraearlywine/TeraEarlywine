# Tera Earlywine 

**Hello! Welcome to my DocBlog Resume!** <br><br>
Full stack data professional with +5 years of industry experience. Specializes in economic and marketplace analysis, data modeling, API automation and data visualization. Basically, I'm like a superhero, but instead of a cape, I wear blue light glasses and instead of fighting crime, I fight against inefficiency. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying to make sense of my own personal data, like how many cups of coffee it takes me to become a functional human being. Lets connect. 

And no, I'm not kidding with the coffee thing.



## **Experience**

Below is a look into the last 5 years of my life and career. <br>
It's had no shortage of learning experiences, mentorship, growing moments, successes and achievements. 
My working style is mostly driven by curiosity, which is why I got my start in data. As time went on I found myself more compelled by engineering and technology. I am self directed and have been described as a inspiring director. 

Below you'll find tabs that have all the relevant information about each job I've had over the last five years. You will find a _very_ extensive overview, of course (Mostly for my own cataloguing). I enjoy story telling. My resume-resume is reserved for applying to jobs, which is a very paired down version of these stories. I enjoy classifying and categorizing information, perhaps including overkill on context.

    **Summary** <br>
    My current role is Data Engineer. I switched teams a little under 8 months ago to work on third party vendor integrations. 
    Day to day includes python modeling in GCP composer environments, code base maintenance and refactoring. I also refreshed the onboarding environment in GCP, which included using tools like terraform to spin up CI/CD resources.

    ??? note 
        
        The pipelines I've worked on were set up by other people, many hands in the pie. Being successful in this job meant 
        ensuring the code was clean and well documented. Since they were inhereted, I spent time adding documentation and building out a testing suite.
