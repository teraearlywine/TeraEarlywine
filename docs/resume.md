# Tera Earlywine 

**Hello! Welcome to my DocBlog Resume!** <br><br>
Full stack data professional with +5 years of industry experience. Specializes in economic and marketplace analysis, data modeling, API automation and data visualization. Basically, I'm like a superhero, but instead of a cape, I wear blue light glasses and instead of fighting crime, I fight against inefficiency. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying to make sense of my own personal data, like how many cups of coffee it takes me to become a functional human being. Lets connect. 

And no, I'm not kidding with the coffee thing.

**Experience**
Below is a look into the last 5 years of my life and career. <br>
It's had no shortage of learning experiences, mentorship, growing moments, successes and achievements. 
My working style is mostly driven by curiosity, which is why I got my start in data. As time went on I found myself more compelled by engineering and technology.
