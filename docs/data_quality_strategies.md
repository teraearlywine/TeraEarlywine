# BUILDING A DATA QUALITY INVESTMENT STRATEGY 

(No, you’re not ready for AI—let’s fix your data first)

This is for tech leaders and employees who think they’re ready for AI but are grappling with foundational data issues. Whether you have a thriving business intelligence team or you’re just “AI-curious,” take a moment to reflect on these questions:

+ Are your dashboards painfully slow?
+ Do your accounting and data teams struggle to collaborate?
+ Is your data warehouse bill spiraling out of control?
+ Are your employees either complaining about too much or too little data? 

If you’re nodding yes to any of these, your business may be heading for unplanned costs and missed opportunities. Before chasing automation or GPT-powered solutions, it’s time to turn your data swamp into a data armory—one designed for scalability, reliability, and AI generated insights.

## DATA QUALITY FOUNDATIONS 
The great thing about data quality is that it can be tackled systematically. Unlike some aspects of business, “quality” here isn’t subjective—it’s shaped by two key forces: your business operations and implementation bugs. Data quality issues generally stem from one of two scenarios:

1.	Business changes that negatively affect customer behavior, leading to unfavorable trends in your metrics.
2.	Gaps in data capture, where critical information isn’t recorded, leaving you blind to essential insights.

While business-driven changes (#1) are often beyond your immediate control (and only fully understood in hindsight), they’re closely tied to #2. If critical events or interactions aren’t tracked, you might miss key signals about customer reactions to a new feature or product change.

To illustrate, let’s revisit an old cliché: If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound? Similarly, in the realm of data: If data is missing from your tables and no one notices, does it matter? The answer is yes—it matters because missing data can create blind spots that obscure both problems and opportunities.

A complete picture of data quality comes down to how complete your data tables are. If your tables are riddled with NULL values, you’re likely facing a significant issue. Missing data not only hinders your ability to understand customer behavior but also undermines trust in your analytics and decision-making processes.
