# Tera Earlywine 

### Introduction

Full stack data professional with +5 years of industry experience. Specializes in economic and marketplace analysis, data modeling, API automation and data visualization. Also knows a thing or two about entreprenuership. Basically, I'm like a superhero, but instead of a cape, I wear blue light glasses and instead of fighting crime, I fight against inefficiency. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me trying to make sense of my own personal data, like how many cups of coffee it takes me to become a functional human being. Lets connect. 

And no, I'm not kidding with the coffee thing.
