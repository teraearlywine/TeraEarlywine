## Welcome

Welcome to my corner of the internet! Iâ€™m Tera Earlywine, a full stack data professional with (quite a few years of) start-up and software technology industry experience. I am currently consulting for various technology companies, and in my spare time am the technical co-founder and Co-President of an AI startup called Cowgirl AI

Basically, I'm like a superhero, but instead of a cape, I wear blue light glasses and instead of fighting crime, I fight against pipeline inefficiency. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me trying to make sense of my own personal data, like how many cups of coffee it takes me to become a functional human being. Lets connect.

Best, 
Tera
