## Welcome


Hello there stranger, friend or stranger friend! Welcome to my personal GitHub repository! I am happy you're here. If you are here, you're likely just going to find this & the docs supporting www.teraearlywine.com

This repo currently points (and publishes to) www.teraearlywine.com, which consists of a more readable website made using mkdocs. The repositories below are merely tasters of python & SQL samples. They have no general use other than highlighting - yes - I can code. If you want to see more of my personal skill set and passions come to light, check out [Earlywine Data Co](https://github.com/Earlywine-Data-Co)


Thanks for stopping by! 

Best,
