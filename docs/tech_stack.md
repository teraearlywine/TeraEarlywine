Tech stack is one of those interesting things employers look for to associate value with corporate fit. Se-la-vie, hopefully most people understand in the data cloud space the skills are easily transferrable.

I am adding this here for the purposes of this website so that any reader might get more context. Ergo - *why* my SQL looks like that.

The tools & languages I primarily work with:

- Github
- VSCODE
- Python
- Airflow
- SQL
- MySQL
- DBT
- Google Cloud Platform
