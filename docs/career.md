# Career

## **Welcome**


**Hello! Welcome to my Career Page!** <br><br>

Full stack data professional with +5 years of industry experience. Specializes in economic and marketplace analysis, data modeling, data engineering, API automation and data visualization. Basically, I'm like a superhero, but instead of a cape, I wear blue light glasses and instead of fighting crime, I fight against inefficiency. When I'm not coding, you can find me trying to make sense of my own personal data, like how many cups of coffee it takes me to become a functional human being. Lets connect.

And no, I'm not kidding with the coffee thing.



## **Experience**

Welcome to an overview of my professional journey over the past five years. This period has been rich with learning experiences, mentorship opportunities, growth, and numerous achievements. My career path, driven largely by a deep-seated curiosity, began in the realm of data. However, as time progressed, my interests increasingly veered towards engineering and technology.


In the sections below, you'll find detailed tabs for each position I've held in the last five years. These provide an extensive overview – a comprehensive catalogue created for both personal reflection and storytelling. I take great pleasure in organizing and presenting information, sometimes delving deeply into context to provide a full picture.


??? note
    What you'll see here is much more detailed than my job-application resume, which is a more concise representation of these experiences. This detailed version is a testament to my love for storytelling and meticulous classification of information.
