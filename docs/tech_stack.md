title: Technology Stack

Tech stack is one of those interesting things employers look for to associate value with corporate fit. This is a weird thing to me. I guess it has to do with how much it costs to train someone, if they already know your entire application suite — no cost to the business (which, by and large is a dangerous assumption)

What I feel often times gets looked over is the potential employee’s ability to adapt and *learn* a new tool. We should not judge people by their tech-stacks, their ability to solve code problems that have no relative corporate application, and instead judge them by their willingness to adapt, to learn and to *try.*

That being said, I am adding this here for the purposes of this website so that any reader might get more context. Ergo - *why* my SQL looks like that.

The tools & languages I primarily work with:

- Github
- VSCODE
- Python
- Airflow
- SQL
- MySQL
- DBT
- Google Cloud Platform
