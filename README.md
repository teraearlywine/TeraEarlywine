# Hello! 

> "Data is like garbage. You'd better know what you are going to do with it before you collect it." - Mark Twain

Welcome to my github repository. As I'm sure you're aware, Github is a _powerful_ tool for project management, engineering and development, and is genuinely the most satisfying archival tool I've ever worked with. (And I've worked with a lot..)



## 7 Guiding Professional Principles

1. Be 2 minutes *early* to meetings
2. For any idea you believe in, always create a proposal
3. Any writing shall be reviewed & edited before sending to others
4. Feedback is a gift, however, delivery is just as important as receiving
5. Data Engineering related work:
    1. Automate, automate, automate! 
    2. Always bake in unit tests & assertions 
    3. Always add doc-strings/code comments
    4. Always have a quality assurance analysis prepared as a deliverable
6. AI is a tool to augment work, not do it for me
7. Data is a gift, so as a data engineer itâ€™s my duty to protect it.
