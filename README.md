Hi! My name is Tera Earlywine. I am a data engineer (part SQL optimization ninja) with over 5 years of tech industry experience. There may have been a bit of foreshadowing when my parents named me Tera—but as it turns out, terabytes of data weren’t as prevalent back then.

Nowadays, I find myself tuning data models processing petabytes into terabytes and terabytes into gigabytes—while exploring how AI can push the boundaries of data processing, SQL interpretation, automation, and development. If I'm not working on query optimization or AI automation projects, I am teaching and mentoring others on similar concepts.

I am also very passionate about data quality and integrity. Before we talk about AI and data enrichment, let’s first discuss how your business handles null values…

Throughout my career, challenging the status quo has lead me to help companies ignite innovative, revenue generating, trailblazing initiatives—and of course, always armed with data.
