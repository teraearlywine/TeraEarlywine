# The Duplication Conundrum

Let's talk about duplicated records. If you ask anyone I’ve worked with, my personal favorite out of all the data quality issues are indeed NULL values (for reasons to be talked about in another post). However today we are going to cover duplicated records and de-duplication methods. Duplicated records are every accountants worst nightmare and a data analysts biggest pain-in-the-ass because everyone approaches solving the problem differently.

Why this article is dubbed 'The Duplication Conundrum' is because every data analyst approaches solving the problem in 3 separate ways (looking at you SQL). Before I get into it, a quick overview → I will first cover what a duplicated record is, why it’s bad and why it exists, so we all have a base-line understanding of the issue at hand. From there I will compare the 3 methods most commonly used and we will figure out which is truly, the best approach (yes - there is one that outshines the rest).
