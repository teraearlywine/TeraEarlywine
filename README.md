Welcome to my GitHub repository. If you're here, that means either you just stumbled on my page (nice) or are a co-worker of past, present, or future (hey friend!). As I'm sure you're aware, GitHub is a *powerful* tool for project management, engineering, and development, and is genuinely the most satisfying archival tool I've ever worked with. (And I've worked with a lot...)


Something I've been reflecting on recently is how I present myself (or at least intend to present myself) professionally. This matters to me because over the pandemic, some of the 'conditioning' from my earlier career has devolved into a more casual approach. For example, I say 'fuck' a lot more in Slack than I should... well. That may never change (sorry mom <3)


So now, as I enter my 6th year, venturing into different echelons of engineering, I think it's important to maintain a continuous practice of things that do matter. So, as of 2024, I curated these seven guiding professional principles that I practice and uphold.



## 7 Guiding Professional Principles

1. Be 2 minutes *early* to meetings
2. For any idea you believe in, always create a proposal
3. Any writing shall be reviewed & edited before sending to others
4. Feedback is a gift, however, delivery is just as important as receiving
5. Data Engineering related work:
    1. Automate, automate, automate! 
    2. Always bake in unit tests & assertions 
    3. Always add doc-strings/code comments
    4. Always have a quality assurance analysis prepared as a deliverable
6. Always push yourself to learn more and to have a sense of humor when things go awry.
7. Data is a gift, you are but a conduit, so honor the information given to you.
